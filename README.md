# 🤗 Hugging Face Open Source Models

This repository includes practice code and examples from the [Open Source Models with Hugging Face](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/open-source-models-hugging-face) course by DeepLearning.AI. It demonstrates hands-on usage of state-of-the-art models for tasks like text generation, summarization, audio classification, image segmentation, and more.
